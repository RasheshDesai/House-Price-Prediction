# House Price Prediction

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and other relevant factors. The model is trained using a dataset of real estate prices and aims to provide accurate price estimations.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Predictions on new data

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook HousePricePrediction.ipynb
   ```
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook ANNModel.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the notebook cells step-by-step to preprocess the data, train the model, and make predictions.

## Dataset
- It contains features such as `location`, `size`, `price`, `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, etc.

## Model
- Various regression models are tested including:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree Regressor
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Gradient Boosting Regressor
- The model performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared score.

## Results
- The best-performing model is selected based on cross-validation and test set performance.
- Key findings from data analysis are visualized using graphs and charts.
